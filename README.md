## Features

* Audio detection and many more..


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Rainmeter v4.5 or newer.** Rainmeter can be installed by downloading the `.exe` file [from Rainmeter's official website.](https://www.rainmeter.net/)
- **JaxCore v40005.** JaxCore can be installed by downloading the `.rmskin` file from [JaxCore's official website.](https://jax-core.github.io/)

### Installation

Assuming you successfully downloaded and installed Rainmeter as well as JaxCore, you can now proceed to install ModularVisualizer by following the steps below.

1. Download and run the `.rmskin` file for **ModularVisualizer** from the official [JaxCore site](https://jax-core.github.io/) to install **ModularVisualizer**.
2. Leave the installation settings at their defaults and click Install.
3. When the installation is finished, a startup pop-up should appear. Follow through the pop-up to finish installing **ModularVisualizer**.

* Note:  If you find that the JaxCore option is red on the startup pop-up, please press the red button and Core will be installed automatically. Perchance this fails, you can manually install Core by downloading the `.rmskin` file from [JaxCore's official website.](https://jax-core.github.io/)

### Customization

Now that you've installed and configured ModularVisualizer, let's take a look at some of its customization options!

* **Layouts:** ModularVisualizer comes with eight custom layouts that you can further customize to your liking.
**Please keep in mind that each layout has a plethora of customization options that are beyond the scope of this guide, so explore them for yourself.**

* Further in-depth customization can be done through the **Appearance**, **Render**, **3D overlay**, and **Audio** tabs. You won't be constrained by the skin's customization capabilities!
